        <p>
          I started programming when I was a high school student using JS and C.
          I have been studying image processing for four years, and I also
          conducted research on optimization for ニコニコ動画.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, my specialty is web performance and frontend infrastructure
          using tools such as webpack, Turborepo, and Vite. In my main job and
          as a technical advisor, I mainly develop products using Next.js.
